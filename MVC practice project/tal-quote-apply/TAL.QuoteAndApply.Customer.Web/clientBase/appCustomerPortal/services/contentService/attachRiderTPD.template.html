<h3>What happens when you bundle your TPD Insurance and Recovery Insurance</h3>
<p>
    Bundle your TPD and Recovery Insurance to your Life Insurance and you'll keep your premium costs down.
    However, if you get a payout for one you'll also reduce the other two by the payout amount.
</p>
<p>
    Make your TPD or Recovery Insurance stand alone from your Life Insurance and youâ€™ll pay more in premiums.
    However, any TPD or Recovery Insurance payout you receive won't affect your Life Insurance.
